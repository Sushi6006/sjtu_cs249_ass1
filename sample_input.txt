The National Homicide Monitoring Program is Australia’s only comprehensive national data collection on homicides combining incidents, victims and offenders. This report describes the 229 homicide incidents recorded by Australian state and territory police between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2016. During this 12-month period there were 235 victims of homicide and 264 identified offenders. Males comprised 65 percent of homicide victims and 86 percent of identified offenders. The victim and offender were known to each other in 82 percent of homicide incidents recorded; a fifth of homicide incidents involved intimate partners. The homicide rate in Australia in 2015–16 was 0.95 per 100,000, the equal lowest rate recorded since 1989–90.
